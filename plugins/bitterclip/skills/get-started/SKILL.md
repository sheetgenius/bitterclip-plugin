# Get started with BitterClip

Get the person to one useful next state: a selected ready Episode, or a clear upload or processing continuation that preserves their original task.

If the request is for a standalone programmable effect or FX Studio scene, use `fx-studio` instead; a Recording or Episode is not a prerequisite for scene authoring.

Use the connected BitterClip MCP server. Let the host perform OAuth; never request, paste, or retain credentials. Use `account_context_get` only when the account or studio is ambiguous. Use `projects_list`, `recordings_list`, and `episodes_list` to discover current work. If an unfamiliar tool contract matters, use `list_docs`, `search_docs`, or `read_doc` narrowly instead of guessing or reading the whole documentation set.

For an existing library, return a small relevant choice rather than an inventory dump. Prefer a searchable, ready Episode that fits the person's latest requested intent and the current Project working brief when available; never assume a personal default Project, source, or destination. Keep every returned handle tool-only. Call `workspace_open` once and last only when the person asked to open, show, edit, or review an exact target; report its `open_status` honestly rather than claiming the host visibly opened something.

For an empty library, create one `upload_link_create` result for the intended Project, or omit the Project for BitterClip's default upload destination. Give the person the host-presented upload action and return to their original goal after upload. Do not create a second link or upload because processing is slow.

After upload, poll `recordings_list` for that exact Recording until it is searchable and has an Episode handle. Follow returned wait or next-action guidance. If processing fails, is denied, or needs user action, report the typed blocker and bounded recovery; do not blindly retry a write.

Stop once the Episode is selected and ready. Continue into clip-making only when the request already includes that outcome.
