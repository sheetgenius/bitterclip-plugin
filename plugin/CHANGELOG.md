# Changelog

## 0.2.1 — local FX recovery candidate

- Tightens the fourth skill's scene runtime, view targeting, guarded recovery,
  and same-Clip scene rebinding guidance; adds anonymized continuation cases.
- Keeps the shared package shape and hosted OAuth service. Local validation
  passed, but this candidate is not host-installed or publicly released. The
  public GitHub download remains 0.1.3; the private host pilot used 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0 — local FX Studio candidate

- Adds `fx-studio`, a fourth shared skill for authoring and refining standalone
  programmable FX Studio scenes before any separately supported production use.
- Keeps the existing three Clip skills, MIT licensing, and hosted OAuth endpoint.
  Privately installed in Claude and as separate ChatGPT skills on 2026-09-21;
  complete editorial acceptance remains open. Not a public GitHub release.

## 0.1.3 — public pilot package

- Adds the MIT license for this plugin package, with the canonical root license
  mirrored in the portable package and both generated archives.
- Maintains the same three shared skills and OAuth endpoint. Published from the
  separate sanitized public repository; not a vendor marketplace approval.

## 0.1.2 — private local consolidation candidate

- After the separate legacy `bitterclip-operator` disablement, consolidates
  still-relevant guidance into the three shared skills while retaining the
  legacy source:
  `get-started`, `make-a-clip`, and `review-and-export`.
- Keeps the single existing OAuth MCP endpoint and the same package shape; it
  does not add hooks or a second skill source.
- This is local package metadata only. It does not claim a host update, grant,
  publication, or server-side behavior change.

## 0.1.1 — private local patch candidate

- Tightens `make-a-clip` guidance for a `clip_create` result with
  `edge_warnings`: retain the exact created Clip, inspect each flagged child
  edge, and revise that same Clip only when source evidence requires it before
  rendering.
- This is host guidance only. It does not claim server-side warning clearance
  or a render-admission gate.

## 0.1.0 — private local pilot

- Initial package source for `get-started`, `make-a-clip`, and
  `review-and-export`.
- Uses the existing OAuth MCP endpoint.
- Host installation and editorial acceptance remain unverified.
